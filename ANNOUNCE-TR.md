This release includes a major overhaul of the Transcribe App:
* Transcribe App now supports Zoom Meeting Assistant App which can submit all your local Zoom Meeting recordings for transcription to the Transcribe App.
* New Transcript Detail display that no longer requires paging and supports transcript from overlapping speech.
* All transcripts are now stored indefinitely. The new Storage Gauge on the home page shows you storage usage. If you start running out of space you can either upgrade to a higher plan or delete some transcripts.
* Transcribe App is now available on Edge - this way you can deploy it to all users in an Enterprise and keep all your confidential data local.

This release includes improved offline speech-recognition model with about 1.5% improvement in accuracy.
