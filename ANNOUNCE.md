### Minor release 1.30.0 is scheduled for 5/10/2021 between 6pm and 9pm CST

New features in this release:
* Improved accuracy of the acoustic models - offline and real-time
* Improved accuracy of the recognizer in Voicebot scenarios
* Ability to set default sensitivity settings from Console Web UI
* Returning ERROR instead of NOINPUT if no bytes were received by the recognizer. This makes troubleshooting of RTP streaming easier. 

### Minor release 1.29.0 is scheduled for 4/27/2021 between 6pm and 9pm CST

New features in this release:
* Support for 2-channel audio streaming via RTP. This is intended mainly for telephony applications where 1 channel is e.g. caller and the 2nd channel is e.g. agent.  
An example script that demonstrates this new functionality is on our [github](https://github.com/voicegain/platform/tree/master/examples/RTP-streaming#ffmpeg-2chn-testpy).
* Added support for MRCP Recognition-Timeout parameter.

### German and Spanish language available
