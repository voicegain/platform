# Voicegain SIP Media Stream B2BUA
Voicegain offers a highly scalable, reliable and fully contained SIP Media Stream B2BUA to address the challenge discussed above. This B2BUA is a containerized network element that is deployed in the same network as the premise-based contact center. From a SIP Protocol standpoint, this Media Stream Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)  acts as a transparent media relay while forking SIP RTP media streams to real-time Speech-to-Text..

Please refer to this link for more information https://www.voicegain.ai/post/accessing-real-time-media-streams-generative-ai 
# FreeSWITCH Transcription Proxy
Proxy your SIP call via our FreeSWITCH docker and get the transcript of the call audio submitted to a websocket service for both Inbound and Outbound calls.

# 1) FreeSWITCH Inbound and Outbound Calling with Dynamic Gateway Handling

This setup enables handling of both **inbound** and **outbound** SIP calls using Lua scripting in FreeSWITCH. It dynamically configures outbound gateways based on runtime variables and supports routing logic based on dialed numbers.

---
## üì• Inbound Calling Logic

### Flow Summary:

1. Parses `config.ini` to load settings like:
   - `FREESWITCH_HOST_DOMAIN`
   - `DESTINATION_DOMAIN`
   - `SIP_GATEWAY_IP`
   - `DIALED_NUMBER_MAPPING`
2. Checks if SIP URI matches `FREESWITCH_HOST_DOMAIN`. If not, call is rejected.
3. If `DIALED_NUMBER_MAPPING` is defined, looks up the mapped URI using the dialed number.
4. Sets the following channel variables:
   - `SIP_PROFILE` (internal/external based on domain/IP)
   - `REDIRECT_URI` (full SIP URI to forward the call)
5. Optional: Initiates Voicegain transcription via WebSocket and attaches custom SIP headers (`uniqueCallId`, `OUTBOUND_CALL_SESSION_ID`, etc).

### Config Parameters (config.ini):

- `FREESWITCH_HOST_DOMAIN`
- `DESTINATION_DOMAIN`
- `SIP_GATEWAY_IP`
- `DIALED_NUMBER_MAPPING`
- `VG_GATEWAY_URL`, `JWT_TOKEN`, `WEBSOCKET_SERVER`, etc. (for Voicegain integration)

---

## üì§ Outbound Calling Logic

### Flow Summary:

1. Checks if the `destination_number` is longer than 10 digits.
2. Optionally matches and strips the `OUTBOUND_CALL_PREFIX`.
3. Validates the presence of outbound config:
   - `OUT_SIP_GATEWAY_IP`
   - `OUTBOUND_CALL_EXT`
   - `OUTBOUND_CALLS_SECRET`
4. Checks if gateway `outbound_gateway` exists and is registered.
5. If not registered:
   - Dynamically creates gateway XML under `sip_profiles/internal/`
   - Triggers `sofia profile internal rescan`
6. Sets outbound call variables:
   - `SIP_PROFILE = gateway/outbound_gateway`
   - `REDIRECT_URI = sip:<number>@<OUT_SIP_GATEWAY_IP>`
   - `VG_GATEWAY_URL`, `JWT_TOKEN`, `WEBSOCKET_SERVER`, etc. (for Voicegain integration)
---

## üîß Gateway Dynamic Creation

- A `<gateway>` XML is written to disk with credentials and proxy info.
- Automatically registered via `sofia profile internal rescan`.
- Works only if the FreeSWITCH profile includes:
  ```xml
  <include>conf/sip_profiles/internal/*.xml</include>
  ```
---
## üìÅ File Overview

### Lua Script (e.g. `check_api.lua`)

- Parses `config.ini`
- Implements logic described above
- Handles transcription API (optional)

Proxy your SIP call via our FreeSWITCH docker and get the transcript of the call audio submitted to a websocket service.
This works basically in two modes 1) if SIP_GATEWAY_IP is configured in config.ini it works in sip trunk mode otherwise 2) send SIP INVITE to DESTINATION_DOMAIN

```Steps for setting up websocket service to receive transciption results in realtime```
# 2) Install required python pacakges
Assuming you have already setup virtual enviornment(not manadatory) and installed required python packages asyncio, websockets,json and ssl. OS can be any linux distribution preferably debian 12 and above.
```sh
apt install python3.11-venv
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
# 3) Create new domain and get certficates :

(Important if you want to access your websocket service using encrypted wss:// instead of ws://)

You need to create new domain for example mydomain.com and obtain certificates using lets encrypt or other openssl and mention the paths in web service python example.
Make sure to replace mydomain.com with your domain name in sample python code.

```sh
apt install certbot
certbot certonly -d mydomain.com
```
replace these lines with your path to certs in python code
```
ssl_cert = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/fullchain.pem"
ssl_key ="/etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/privkey.pem"
```
# 4) How to obtain secret key mentioned in python code

Go to and login into https://console.voicegain.ai Under API Security create Auth Configuration and select type as Bearer and enter a random string string as credential - note that it should be the same as the SECRET_KEY mentioned in python script. When call is bridged Voicegain gateway will make connection to your websocket server and it will pass this secrect key as Bearer in header request then on the websocket server side upon receving this key you should validate and proceed further. This has already been done in the python example code. 

# 5) Launch Websocket Server
```sh
python ws_server.py
```
# 6) Modify config.ini for Freeswitch docker 
A sample config.ini can be found in this repository.
```ini
# This is the SIP B2BUA host where you will be sending SIP traffic to 
FREESWITCH_HOST_DOMAIN=fs1lab.ascalon.ai
# If this value is present then this IP used as SIP trunk to make outbound calls
SIP_GATEWAY_IP=10.1.0.4:64793
# This is the final SIP destination domain where will be proxying to.
#if SIP_GATEWAY_IP is ip mentioned above then this below value will be ignored 

# This is the final SIP destination domain where calls will be proxying to just like sending SIP INVITE to domain.
DESTINATION_DOMAIN=fs.ascalon.ai:5080

# This is useful only when you want to dial calls to SIP_GATEWAY_IP using sip gateway instead of DESTINATION_DOMAIN.
# It works much like sip trunk so for this feature to work you must comment out or put DESTINATION_DOMAIN=(empty)
SIP_GATEWAY_IP=SIPTRUNK_IP:64793

# Incoming caller when dialing call as 1233@FREESWITCH_HOST_DOMAIN translates to 4567@SIP_GATEWAY_IP. This might be useful in call center evnvironment. 
DIALED_NUMBER_MAPPING=1233:4567

# this main voicegain API gateway URL 
VG_GATEWAY_URL=https://api.voicegain.ai/v1/asr/transcribe/async

JWT_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXCcccccccyJhbGciOiJIUzx1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.

# this is the Auth Configuration name that you have created in previous steps above,
# so the Voicegain gateway will use this name and pickup credential and auth typementioned in the portal
# and make a connection to your websocket server so that you can validate it. 
AUTH_NAME=fsproxy

# This is your websocket server URL where transcription results are posted in real-time
WEBSOCKET_SERVER=wss://mydomain.com:8765

# names for the left and right channel sessions
LEFT_CHANNEL_NAME=CALLER1
RIGHT_CHANNEL_NAME=CALLER2

# options are words OR segments
#words - words with confidence and timing info [also sent over websocket]
#segments -- segments (or partial hypotheses) [also sent over websocket, note that latency of segments is higher than that of words by about 300-500ms]]
CONTENT_INCREMENTAL=words
OUT_SIP_GATEWAY_IP=10.1.0.4
OUTBOUND_CALL_PREFIX=33
OUTBOUND_CALL_EXT=1000
OUTBOUND_CALLS_SECRET=1234
DIALED_NUMBER_MAPPING=1233:4567

# now, if you want you can change the sensitivity value on the Context from which the JWT is obtained
SENSITIVITY=1
AUDIO_CAPTURE=true
# configurable noAudioTimeout parameter to the freeswitch docker that can disconnect webscocket session in case no audio in 30 secs, if this param is ommitted it takes default value of 30 sec.
NOAUDIOTIMEOUT=30000 

```
# 7) Obtain FreeSWITCH proxy docker

You will need to request from Voicegain a key vg-customer-private-ro-key.json that will give you access to Voicegain artifact repository. Run below command at linux terminal.
```sh
cat vg-customer-private-ro-key.json | sudo docker login -u _json_key --password-stdin https://us-docker.pkg.dev
```

# 8) Run FreeSWITCH docker
With host networking:
```sh
-v option specifies local file path where config.ini is located this needs to be changed to where the file was copied.
-m to limit memory usage by freewitch docker so below example puts 1GB limit
```sh
docker run -d --name fsproxy --network=host -m 1g -v /Path_to/config.ini:/etc/config.ini us-docker.pkg.dev/voicegain-prod/vg-customer-private/freeswitch-transcription-proxy:0.14.6
```
With bridge networking:
```sh

-v option specifies local file path where config.ini is located this needs to be changed to where the file was copied.
docker run -d --name fsproxy -p -p 5060:5060/tcp -p 5060:5060/udp -v /Path_to/config.ini:/etc/config.ini us-docker.pkg.dev/voicegain-prod/vg-customer-private/freeswitch-transcription-proxy:0.15.0
```

Note 1: Be cartefull with the path to the config.ini and env file on Windows systems

Note 2: If you get an error mentioning `parseConfigFile` and `Is a directory` the most likely the path to config.ini was incorrectly provided

# 9) Prepare sip phone to make call to SIP URI

You can use, for example, [Linphone](./LINPHONE.md)

You will be making the call to the FreeSWITCH running in the docker. The SIP URI will be, for example, df3d29f1-856d-470d-887d-445f01541dcb@fs1lab.ascalon.ai;transport=tcp
where the domain will be same where the docker is running and the part before @ will be your destination on the DESTINATION_DOMAIN (from config.ini)

NOTE: if you are testing on localhost and your SIP Phone is also on localhost, make sure that the phone is not listening on port 5060 which is needed by FreeSWITCH

# 10) Testing
After setting up the application, make a call from any SIP Softphone or Linphone to URL. Once the B party answers the call, you will see live audio text messages on the ws_server.py console.
