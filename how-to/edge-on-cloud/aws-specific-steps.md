## <a id="step1"></a>Step 1: Request GPUs from AWS
In order to use GPUs you must request a Quota increase for them from AWS.

The instance types (P type, G type/ On-demand, Spot instances) that you require are dependent on your Organizations needs.  

AWS Links: 
* [Instance purchasing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html)
* [Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

Be certain you are requesting them for the AWS Region you wish to run your cluster in.

## <a id="step2"></a>Step 2: Create Cluster and Node Groups

Log into your AWS Console and go to EKS.

![Goto EKS](./AWS-EKS.PNG)

Now create your cluster. This will require a Cluster Role and Node Group  
AWS Links: 
* [Creating Amazon EKS Cluster Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html#create-service-role)  
* [AWS Current Guide for Kubernetes Cluster creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html)  

Below are some screenshots (for generic details see the above two links).

Cluster creation

![Create Cluster](./AWS-1a.png)


When you reach the "Cluster endpoint access" card in Cluster Creation; it is required that the API server enpoint is Publically and Privately available, 
however it is recommended that you limit access to your Organization's access IP and Voicegain's access IP. For security purposes this IP address is avaialble upon request.  
**Please contact Voicegain to receive the required Voicegain Access IP address.**

Networking add-ons can we left with the default values:

![Networking Add-Ons](./AWs-net-add-ons.PNG)

You can choose to send EKS logs to CloudWatch

![EKS logs](./AWS-ctrl-plane-log.PNG)

On the next page we leave all values default.

The page after that is where the cluster gets created - takes about 15 minutes.

![EKS - creating cluster](./EKS-creating.PNG)

Once the cluster becomes active we can add and define Node Groups.
Node Groups define which GPU and non-GPU Compute Instances are to be used for the cluster. This is what will spin up the EC2 instances as worker nodes for your cluster.  
AWS Link: [Creating Amazon Node Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-managed-node-group.html)
![EKS - Add Node Group](./AWS-add-node-group.PNG)

We generally create two Node Groups: one for GPU instances and one for non-GPU instances.

On the first page of node group creation this is all we need to enter:

![EKS - GPU Node Group](./AWS-GPU-node-group.PNG)

When creating the NodeGroup make certain that you are setting the systems to have at least 50gb disks.

![NodeGroup Config Disk](./AWS-2b.png)

Additionally, under Node Group scaling configuration; set your Minimum size, Maximum size and Desired size to the same number of nodes you've determined your organization requires. In this case we create a node group that will have exactly 3 instances:

![NodeGroup Scaling](./AWS-2c.png)

Until we test multi-zone capable Persistent Volumes, on the next page you will need to deselect all but one zone. (This document will be updated accordingly once we have determined correct configuration where persistent volumes behave correctly in a multi-zone cluster.)

![NodeGroup Single Zone](./AWS-single-zone.png)

Next page is fine with the defaults so you can click the Create button at the bottom of it. 

While this node group is being created, we can proceed and create the second node group for non-GPU instances. The scaling setting for this group also needs to be 3 - 3 - 3.

![EKS - non-GPU Node Group](./AWS-non-GPU-node-group.PNG)

For non-GPU node group we also select just one networking zone - the same that we selected for the GPU node group.

Eventually, we will have two node groups (they will not take much time to finish creating):

## <a id="step3"></a>Step 3: Install and Configure kubectl and awscli
### Install Kubectl

As stated in the Universal Steps guide, Kubectl is required and assumed to be running on a linux system able to reach to the K8s Cluster:  
Local system setup, install Kubectl following [these instructions from kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Install and configure awscli

If using Python: 
<pre>
python -m pip install awscli --user
aws configure
</pre>
You can test for successful configuration with:
<pre>
aws eks list-clusters
</pre>

## <a id="step4"></a>Step 4: Get kubeconfig

Retrieve kubernetes configuration file:
<pre>
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
</pre>
And test access with the following:  
<pre>
kubectl get nodes
</pre>

![Kubeconfig and get nodes](./AWS-kube-list-nodes.PNG)

All done here!

## <a id="step5"></a>Step 5: Continue on Voicegain Web Console 

[Continue with universal deployment guide Step 2](./universal-deployment-guide.md#Step2)

## <a id="step6"></a>Step 6: Configure the Load Balancer for Access to your Edge Voicegain Web Console and the Voicegain Web API on AWS

The load balancer was created during Voicegain Edge deployment

We use the EC2 Feature Load Balancer

![AWS LB type choice](./AWS-which-LB.PNG)

Here is what a basic configuration of the load balancer looks like. 
If you had other load balancers, you can find the one assigned to your new Edge cluster by checking the hostname - it will be the one in the URL to access Edge Web Console.

![AWS LB basic config](./AWS-LB-basic-conf.PNG)

Of the two security groups we need to configure the `elb` one:

![AWS LB security groups](./AWS-LB-elb-sec-grp.PNG)

We can edit the inbound rules on the security group, in particular here the HTTP port 80 inbound rule, you can e.g. add ACL for IPs:
