# Terms of Service

# 1. Agreement Process and Definitions

**1.1	Overview.** As noted above, this Agreement consists of these Terms of Service, the Policies, and each Order signed by authorized representatives of Voicegain and Customer (each a “party” and collectively the “parties”). Each party may sign this Master Subscription Agreement and each Order online with a digital signature, or in hard copy with an ink signature. No oral agreement or partially signed document will be enforceable.

**1.2	Edge Subscription Products, SaaS Services and Professional Services.** Voicegain provides a suite of Edge Subscription Products, SaaS Services and Professional Services (each as defined in this Agreement collectively herein called Services) built on Voicegain’s deep-learning-based Speech-to-text and NLU platform. Upon both parties signing one or more Orders, Customer may order new, additional, or different Services.

**1.3	Orders.** Each Order may contain additional contractual provisions; but this Agreement and each Order may only be modified by a written document signed by both parties that expressly amends one or more provisions of the Terms of Service or the Order provisions. No Order may be used to amend the Terms of Service. In the event of any conflict or ambiguity, the provisions of each Order will control all Services provided pursuant to that Order, and an Order will take priority over an ambiguous term in these Terms of Service. Any terms and conditions included in a Customer’s purchase order or a Voicegain Invoice, or any other document not signed by both parties, shall not bind either party, unless expressly referenced in this Agreement (e.g., the Policies).

**10.5	Export.** The parties recognize that portions of the Software may be subject to the export regulations of the United States of America and the services, assistance, technical data, information, documents and materials provided by Voicegain to the Customer (collectively, the “controlled items") may constitute defense services, technical data, or commercial or dual-use items or information controlled under the U.S. export control laws and regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and the Export Administration Regulations. The Customer shall not either directly or indirectly use, sell or re-sell, transfer, transship, disclose, export or re-export, or otherwise dispose of any such controlled items to any foreign person (as defined under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations), either in original form or after being incorporated through an intermediate process into other end-items, without prior authorization from the U.S. Government.

**10.6	Non-Solicitation.** Customer agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to refrain from soliciting for employment, directly or indirectly, any employee of Voicegain during the Term of this Agreement and for 6 months after termination. Solicitation shall not include responses to any general advertisements. This provision shall not apply to any person hired by Customer three months or more after the person ceases to be an employee of Voicegain.

**10.7 	No Waiver.** The failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect that party’s right to enforce such provisions, nor shall the waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement be taken or held to be a waiver of any further breach of the same provision.

**10.8	Dispute Resolution.** Any claim or dispute between the parties, whether or not arising out of this Agreement or its performance, including any request for injunctive relief, shall be determined by one arbitrator in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules. To accommodate the parties’ geographic locations, the parties and their counsel will participate, and witnesses will testify, by telephone and videoconference technology. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding on the parties, and may be entered and enforced in any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.

**10.9	Counterparts; Facsimile.** This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. The parties agree that a facsimile signature may substitute for and have the same legal effect as the original signature.

**10.10	Entire Agreement.** This Agreement, including the Orders and any attached exhibits, constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any and all previous representations, understandings, or agreements between the parties as to the subject matter hereof. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. This Agreement may only be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the parties. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to the party that drafted it. Any ambiguity shall not be interpreted against either party and shall, instead, be resolved in accordance with other applicable rules concerning the interpretation of contracts.
